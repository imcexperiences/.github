## **The IMC** difference
Our clients tell us it’s these things that make working with us so rewarding.
### Strategy first
We design every IMC experience using a unique, proven formula we call "S>C>P" — strategy, creative, production. S>C>P creates clarity, saves time and ensures every detail of your event directly contributes to your business goal.
### Inclusive from the start
IMC believes DEIB is moral imperative.  Founded and led by a queer couple (NGLCC Certified), our majority-diverse staff works everyday to welcome different perspectives, mobilize buying power, and create a sense of belonging at all our experiences.
### Led by values
Our values create value by focusing us on what matters most to you. And they aren't on mugs or posters. We live them. IMC's values are front and center in our work, and guide every decision we make.
### Accomplished makers
IMC's team of bona fide makers are recognized at the top of their creative and corporate fields. From Cannes to Broadway, and from startups to Fortune 100s, our real-world expertise merges business experience and artistic skill in a way no other agency can.
### True partnership
Our most important differentiator: we love our clients. We're a team of genuine partners who get to know you, make your success our success, and always look out for your best interests (especially when you're not in the room).
